# Ydl - Simple webui for YouTube downloads

## Why

I noticed that some of my favorite clips were being removed from YouTube and 
since thay are a part of my integrity and memories I started to download them
before they are lost.

After having done this manually for a while I thought: "Hmm. This could be 
the work of the computer and I could instead learn new things about Angular 
and stuff.".

So here I am reading and writing new code to learn and to share.

## What

Copy and Paste url to Ydl and expect the server to fetch the video and
store it to some path.

## How

Using Angular frontend and http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ 

## Legal
