# Ydl - Simple webui for YouTube downloads

## Why

I noticed that some of my favorite clips were being removed from YouTube and
since thay are a part of my integrity and memories I started to download them
before they are lost.

After having done this manually for a while I thought: "Hmm. This could be
the work of the computer and I could instead learn new things about Angular
and stuff.".

So here I am reading and writing new code to learn and to share.

## What

Copy and Paste Youtube url to Ydl and expect your server to fetch the video and
store it to some path.

## How

Using Angular frontend and http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

## Development instructions

Install node `sudo pkg install node`. I used version 0.10. Internet says npm comes with it, but I had
to install npm tooi `sudo pkg install npm`.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `gulp`. I have gulp in `node_modules/.bin/gulp`.

## Legal

TODO: Add a suitable open licence here...

Note that you must agree to YouTube legalities too, when using this. I can not
take your responsibilities here.
